[Table Of Contents](TableOfContents.md)

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.  

Please note we have a [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## How to contribute

Feel free to check out our issues; we'll track bugs and flaws there, which are usually an easy and quick way to 
get into the project and start contributing.  If you're feeling bold, take a look at our [Roadmap](Roadmap.md). 
We'll list the general plan from high-level concepts to specific features there.  Please start a discussion before
tackling anything more than trivial tasks to ensure your pull request will be accepted.

There are two levels to this project; the abstract [Specification](Documentation.md) of the protocol and concrete
implementations (eg [DotNet](dotnet/DotNetDocumentation.md).  All implementations must adhere to the contract of the 
Specification at a minimum.

If you don't want to get into coding just yet, documentation is always appreciated! Get cracking on tutorials, FAQs, 
pr walkthroughs, especially if you just went through the process yourself and wish someone had written it up for you.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed.
2. Update the README.md or related documentation with details of changes.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one or more maintainers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the maintainer merge it for you.
