# Conversion to .NET 6.0 TODO

* Translators (handle properties)
* Default includes
* JObject expansion
* web api interface
* Custom Serializer interface?
* ActionResult handler
* Tests
* Pre and Post actions
* DEpendency injection in GetSourceValue
* Type Configuration with a dynamic action rather than a static Type so we can do something like 'all versions of MyClass<T>' or 'Everything that implements IMyPublicInterface'
